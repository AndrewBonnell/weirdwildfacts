Welcome to my GitHub Pages blog! This is a simple post to share my thoughts and experiences.

## Why I Started This Blog

I've always wanted a space to share my journey in tech and beyond. GitHub Pages makes it easy to create a static site for free, and Markdown keeps things simple!

## What You'll Find Here

- **Tech Tutorials**: I'll share step-by-step guides on various programming topics.
- **Project Updates**: Follow along as I build and improve my projects.

2. **[Project B](https://github.com/username/project-b)** - A web application for tracking habits.
